IF group consumed all calories within 8-hour window. Primary outcomes measured at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks.\n\nResults: IF group showed significant reductions in HbA1c (-0.8%, p<0.01), fasting glucose (-22 mg/dL, p<0.01), and LDL cholesterol (-15 mg/dL, p<0.05). No significant changes in HDL or triglycerides.
